\section{Conclusions and future work}

When a place belonging to the ontology class $c$ is recommended, next recommendations with places from $c$ will have lower novelty. The equation \ref{eq:novelty} was proposed with the hypotheses of that if a user already knows places from class $c$, then it is probably he already knows other places from class $c$. With that hypotheses, our system gives poor novelty.
