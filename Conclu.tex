\section{Conclusions and future work} \label{section:conclu}

In this paper we present RECESO, our proposal for a context-aware recommender system that is able to recommend varied Points of Interest (POI), hence increasing serendipity. In order to do so, we use a spreading activation algorithm for the user model and the contextual model and we use a proposed aging system which gives more priority to POIs that are not frequently recommended. RECESO should be integrated with a mobile app or a web app able to gather user information and contextual information, including location. \textcolor{red}{To evaluate the performance of RECESO, we perform some experiments, by simulating visits of four simulated tourists, based on real preferences obtained through a survey. We are developing a more complete version of RECESO, including all its modules. We expect to perform more validations with real scenarios and receive feedback about the relevance, suitability regarding context, and serendipity of the recommendations.}

%After describing the system, we explain some experiments for testing it. These experiments are done simulating interactions of some simulated tourists, based on real preferences obtained through a survey. In future work, RECESO should be deployed and be tested by real interactions and receive feedback about the relevance, suitability regarding context and serendipity of the recommendations.
