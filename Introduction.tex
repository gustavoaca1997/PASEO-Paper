\section{Introduction}
Usually, people depend on places' reviews to decide where to spend their vacations, their free time or even their lunch or just their afternoon, but this requires prior knowledge of the existence of the places. Furthermore, sometimes people know about a place but do not know if it is a good fit for their necessities and ignores it, taking the risk of missing a good experience. This is why a recommender system is useful for tourism, a system able to predict user's preferences based on previous activity, however this kind of systems do not usually consider user's context, such as weather (\textit{is it raining?}) or time (\textit{is it night?}). This motivates us to build a recommender system for tourism aware of user's context, able to recommend a set of places of interest that will meet his preferences, based on his previous activity.
