Tourism is one of the most promising areas for diverse applications and is becoming an extremely
important market \cite{buhalis2011tourism,murphy2013tourism,fermoso2015open,ku2015cultivating,alghamdi2016tourism,artemenko2017tourism,kazandzhieva2019tourism}. 
When travellers are going or planning to go to a destination, they try to collect information about their new destination “as best they can” (e.g., by going to the tourist office or by obtaining information about their destination and its surroundings on the Internet). Usually, tourists depend on places' reviews to decide where to spend their vacations, their free time, or even their lunch or just their afternoon, but this requires prior knowledge of the existence of the places. Furthermore, sometimes people know about a place but do not know if it is a good fit for their necessities and ignores it, taking the risk of missing a good experience. Nevertheless, this requires a considerable amount of effort on the part of the tourists.

Currently, there is a plethora of applications offering information on cities and historical centres, points of interest (POIs) to visit, city tours, green areas to rest, etc. The use of such applications implies that the user is first aware of them, then installs them in the hope that they are suitable (only 10\% of downloaded mobile applications are used more than once), learns and knows how
to use them and then filters the data/information that is uploaded or offered. Most of these
applications follow the PULL paradigm, i.e., the user has to explicitly search for
suggestions/recommendations through interaction with the application’s graphical user interface.
We believe that this is one of the reasons why these types of applications are not successful: they
require too many steps, too many interactions, and too many unknowns. On the other hand, a
PUSH approach, in which the application proactively triggers a recommendation process when
necessary (for example, when the user is close to a POI, when lunch time is approaching, or
when weather conditions change) seems to be a more reasonable solution. A first step in this
direction has been taken by Google via Google Now\footnote{https://www.google.com/intl/fr/landing/now/}, 
which provides information/suggestions
to users by detecting in their geographical environment what they need according to their
location and time. However, such applications are simplistic and use only a limited amount of
information, and moreover, do not take into account the user’s activity. A key element is the
consideration of the users' context, such as their locations, weather (\textit{is it raining?}), or time (\textit{is it night?}).

Recommender Systems are now at the heart of
much research and offer real benefits to users, organizations, and the business community in
general~\cite{borras2014intelligent,del2016pull,leskovec2020mining}. In the context of tourism, most recommender systems are able to predict user's preferences based on previous activities, but research on Context-Aware Recommender Systems
(CARS) are still to be further developed~\cite{adomavicius2011context,nejma2015service,haruna2017context,raza2019progress}. Additionally, most recommender systems do not consider to vary the recommendations -- i.e., they become predictable  for same users, under the same situations. Thus, there is still a real need for research and design of innovative solutions in this field. Nowadays, the use of ontologies to represent the knowledge related to tourism (POI, users' information, context information, etc.) is becoming a powerful tool to offer such as innovative solutions \cite{rajaonarivo2019rec} \cite{bahramian_abbaspour_claramunt_2017}, being DATAtourisme\footnote{http://info.datatourisme.gouv.fr/ontology/core/2.0/} a good example.

In this context, in this work we propose a user-centric hybrid recommender system, using an ontology-based algorithm for content-based and context-aware recommendations. According to the users’ wishes, the serendipity of recommendations may increase (e.g., surprise events, unrepeated recommendations)~\cite{kotkov2016survey}. All this based on an {\it aging}-like algorithm, which gives less priority to recently recommended places.  It is also desirable that the user knows why something is recommended (i.e., that the recommendations are explainable). We describe the architecture and algorithms of our recommender system. To demonstrate its suitability and performance, we test it in different simulated scenarios using different weights or priorities for the predicted preferences, context activations, aging and distances of the recommended places.

We organize the rest of this paper as follows. In Section \ref{section:related-work}, we survey
